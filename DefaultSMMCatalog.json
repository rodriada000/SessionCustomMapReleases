This park offers a large number of gaps and ledges which work really well with Sessions physics. Tag me in any edits or lines so I can see, and most of all enjoy this map\r\n\r\nAnd as a side note if this is one of the first parks you're downloading, make sure to cap the FPS to 60 or 90 to avoid a weird rotating board that happens when you have an extremely high framerate",
